# Book Search Engine
The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Originally built with a RESTful API, the project was intended to be refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for building the application.

## Why the Project Couldn't be Finished

I was unable to finish getting the project up and running. I tried using stackoverflow / ChatGPT to troubleshoot my errors but was unsuccesful. Hopefully at some point I can come back to this one once I have more experience.
